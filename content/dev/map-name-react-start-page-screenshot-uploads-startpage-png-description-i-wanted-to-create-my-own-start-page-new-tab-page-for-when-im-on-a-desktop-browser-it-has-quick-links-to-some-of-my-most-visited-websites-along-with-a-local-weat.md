description: I wanted to create my own start page / new tab page for when I'm on
  a desktop browser. It has quick links to some of my most visited websites,
  along with a local weather forecast powered by the OpenWeather API. I also
  wanted a quick search bar that redirected me to a google search of whatever
  was typed in the bar.

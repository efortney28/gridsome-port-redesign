# Personal Portfolio
This is the most recent version of my personal development and photography portfolio. I wanted something that was cheap (free) to host, and had a barebones (minimal) content management system. I wanted to be able to post pictures for my photography portfolio with some information about each picture, along with a screenshot of each web project for my development portfolio. Netlify CMS was a great choice for me because I could render the markdown files and use them to create new "posts" on corresponding pages.

# Technologies Used
- VueJS with Gridsome for SEO and SSR
- Netlify for host
- Netlify CMS for content management
- GraphQL for data
